Do-Re-Myth is an (experimental) Open Source Game-Based Ear Training Software.

It is a collaborative project between Yuval Adler and Néstor Nápoles López and has been funded by the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) as a CIRMMT Student Project in 2019.

The first official release of Do-Re-Myth (v0.1) is available for:

- [Windows 10](https://github.com/musicianship-game/ear-training/releases/download/v0.1/DoReMyth_v0.1_Win10.zip)
- [macOS](https://github.com/musicianship-game/ear-training/releases/download/v0.1/DoReMyth_v0.1_macOS.zip)


## macOS warnings

If you are running the compiled versions we provide for Win10 or macOS, please take into account that macOS might require you to grant access to the binary before running it.

See this [topic on macOS support](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac) and this [issue](https://github.com/musicianship-game/ear-training/issues/10).

## Development

Requirements:

- Unity `2018.2.11f1`
- Chunity (Original release, May 25 2018)

The game has been built with this Unity version because it was the version supporting Chunity.

Best results will be obtained if using that version to open the project.

A newer version of Chunity is available now (`1.0.2`) and it may be possible to update the Unity version with it. We haven't tried this so let us know if it works.
